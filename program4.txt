ANSWERS

A) Create the above tables by properly specifying the primary keys and the foreign keys.

SQL> CREATE TABLE PERSON(

2 DID VARCHAR2(20) PRIMARY KEY,

3 DNAME VARCHAR2(20),

4 DADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));

Table created.

SQL> CREATE TABLE CAR (

2 CREGNO VARCHAR2(20) PRIMARY KEY,

3 CMODEL VARCHAR2(20),

4 CYEAR NUMBER(10));

Table created.

SQL> CREATE TABLE ACCIDENT(

2 REPNO NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,

3 REPDATE DATE,

4 LOCATION VARCHAR2(20));

Table created.

2 DID VARCHAR2(20) REFERENCES PERSON PRIMARY KEY,

SQL> CREATE TABLE OWNS(

3 CREGNO VARCHAR2(20) REFERENCES CAR);

Table created.

SQL> CREATE TABLE PARTICIPATED

2 DID VARCHAR2(20) REFERENCES PERSON PRIMARY KEY,

3 CREGNO VARCHAR2(20) REFERENCES CAR,

4 REPNO NUMBER (10) REFERENCES ACCIDENT,

5 DAMAGEAMT NUMBER(10));

Table created.


B) Enter at least five tuples for each relation.

SQL> INSERT INTO PERSON VALUES('&DID', '&DNAME', '&DADDRESS');

Enter value for did: D-101

Enter value for dname: HARSHA

Enter value for daddress: BANGALORE

1 row created.

SQL> INSERT INTO CAR VALUES('&CREGNO', '&CMODEL', '&CYEAR');

Enter value for cregno: KA-47-01

Enter value for cmodel: SWIFT

Enter value for cvear: 2001

1 row created.

SQL> INSERT INTO ACCIDENT VALUES(&REPNO, '&REPDATE', '&LOCATION');

Enter value for repno: 1

Enter value for repdate: 01-JAN-18

Enter value for location: BANGALORE

1 row created.


SQL> INSERT INTO OWNS VALUES('&DID', '&CREGNO');

Enter value for did: D-101

Enter value for cregno: KA-47-01

1 row created.

SQL> INSERT INTO PARTICIPATED VALUES('&DID', '&CREGNO', &REPNO, &DAMAGEAMT);

Enter value for did: D-101

Enter value for cregno: KA-47-01

Enter value for repno: 1

Enter value for damageamt: 1000

1 row created..


C) View the Tables.

SQL> SELECT FROM PERSON;

SQL> SELECT FROM CAR;

SQL> SELECT FROM ACCIDENT;

SQL> SELECT FROM OWNS;

SQL> SELECT FROM PARTICIPATED;


D) Demonstrate How You

i) Update Damage amount For The Car Of a Specific Regno In Accident Table With Report no 1 To 3

Sql> UPDATE PARTICIPATED SET DAMAGEAMT-25000

 WHERE

CREGNO-KA-47-03

AND

REPNO BETWEEN 1 AND 4;

SQL> SELECT FROM PARTICIPATED;


ii) add a new accident to the database

SQL> INSERT INTO ACCIDENT VALUES(6,01-JUN-2022', 'BELAGAVI');

SOL> SELECT FROM ACCIDENT;


E) find the total number of people whose owned cars were involved in accidents in 2018.

SQL> SELECT COUNT(DID) FROM ACCIDENT, PARTICIPATED

 WHERE

 REPDATE BETWEEN 01-JAN-18 AND 31-DEC-18' AND

 ACCIDENT.REPNO-PARTICIPATED.REPNO;


F) find the number of accidents in which cars belonging to a specific model were involved.

SQL> SELECT FROM CAR;

SQL> SELECT COUNT(CMODEL) FROM ACCIDENT, PARTICIPATED, CAR

 WHERE

ACCIDENT.REPNO-PARTICIPATED.REPNO

 AND CAR.CREGND-PARTICIPATED.CREGNO

AND CAR.MODEL = " NANO";
