A) Create the above tables by properly specifying the primary keys and the foreign keys.
SQL> CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
REGNO VARCHAR2 (10) PRIMARY KEY,

SNAME VARCHAR2(20),
 MAJOR VARCHAR2(10), DOB DATE);
Table created.
SQL> CREATE TABLE COURSE(
 CID VARCHAR2(10) PRIMARY KEY,
 CNAME VARCHAR2 (10),
 CDEPT VARCHAR2 (10)) ;
Table created.
SOL> CREATE TABLE ENROLL
2
REGNO VARCHAR2(10) REFERENCES STUDENT, CID VARCHAR2(10) REFERENCES COURSE SEM VARCHAR2 (10),
5 MARKS NUMBER (10));
Table created.
SQL> CREATE TABLE TEXTBOOK(
2 BISBN VARCHAR2(10) PRIMARY KEY, BTITLE VARCHAR2(10), PUBLISHER VARCHAR2(10), BAUTHOR VARCHAR2(10));
Table created.
SOL> CREATE TABLE BOOKADOPTION (
2
CID VARCHAR2(10) REFERENCES COURSE, SEM VARCHAR2(10),
4 BISBN VARCHAR2 (10) REFERENCES TEXTBOOK PRIMARY KEY):
Table created.

B) INSERT TUPLES INTO EACH TABLES
SQL> INSERT INTO STUDENT VALUES('&REGNO', '&SNAME', '&MAJOR', '&DOB");
SQL> INSERT INTO COURSE VALUES('&CID', '&CNAME', '&CDEPT');
(SOL> INSERT INTO ENROLL VALUES('&REGNO', '&CID', &SEM, &MARKS) ;
SOL> INSERT INTO TEXTBOOK VALUES('&BISBN', '&BTITLE*, '&BPUBLISHER', '&BAUTHOR');
SQL> INSERT INTO BOOKADOPTION VALUES('&CID', &SEM, '&BISBN*);

[DI DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU ADD NEW TEXT BOOK TO THE DATABASE AND MAKE THAT BOOK IS ADOPTED BY SOME DEPARTMENT
SQL> INSERT INTO TEXTBOOK VALUES ('B-4Â°, 'C+** , "SHIVANI', 'SCHAND')

1 row created.
INSERT INTO BOOKADOPTION VALUES( "C-2', '5', 'B-4*);
1 row created.

E) PRODUCE A LIST OF (COURSEID, BOOK ISBN, BOOK TITLE) IN THE ALPHABETIC ORDER OF COURSES OFFERED BY THE 'SCIENCE' DEPT THAT HAS TWO OR MORE BOOKS.

SQL> SELECT COURSE.CID, BOOKADOPTION.BISBN, TEXTBOOK. BTITLE FROM COURSE, BOOKADOPTION, TEXTBOOK
 WHERE
COURSE.CID-BOOKADOPTION.CID
AND
 BOOKADOPTION. BISBN=TEXTBOOK. BISBN
 AND
 COURSE.CID IN (SELECT COURSE.CID FROM COURSE, BOOKADOPTION WHERE
 COURSE.CID-BOOKADOPTION.CID

SAND
 CDEPT-'SCIENCE"
GROUP BY COURSE.CID HAVING COUNT (*)>=2)
ORDER BY CNAME;

F) LIST ANY DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ALL ITS ADOPTED BOOKS THAT ARE PUBLISHED BY A SPECIFIC PUBLISHER

SOL> SELECT DISTINCT COURSE.CDEPT
 FROM
COURSE, BOOKADOPTION, TEXTBOOK
 WHERE
 TEXTBOOK. BISBN=BOOKADOPTION. BISBN

AND
 BOOKADOPTION.CID=COURSE.CID
 AND
